<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

PyRayT is a geometric ray tracing package with the goal of being "fast enough" to do general purpose optical designs.
All components are objects that can be manipulated in 3D space, and numpy is used extensively under the hood to speed up
simulations. Simulation results are saved as pandas dataframes for easy manipulation and export.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Getting Started

You can install PyRayT from PYPI with
```shell
py -m pip install pyrayt
```

## Usage

Coming soon!

<!-- ROADMAP -->

## Roadmap

PyRayT is currently in active development. Below are a couple planned features for future releases:

- Support for Chromatic Dispersion
- Support for absorbing (k!=0) materials
- Plotting render results in 2&3D
- Exporting designs to a portable format
- Saving simulation results to a database object or similar

See the [open issues](https://github.com/rfrazier716/PyRayT/issues) for a list of proposed features (and known issues).
